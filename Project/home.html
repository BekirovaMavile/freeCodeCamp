      The Fellowship of the Ring is the first of three volumes of the epic novel
      The Lord of the Rings by the English author J. R. R. Tolkien. It is
      followed by The Two Towers and The Return of the King. It takes place in
      the fictional universe of Middle-earth, and was originally published on 29
      July 1954 in the United Kingdom. The volume consists of a foreword, in
      which the author discusses his writing of The Lord of the Rings, a
      prologue titled "Concerning Hobbits, and other matters", and the main
      narrative in Book I and Book II.

      The Lord of the Rings is composed of six "books", aside from an
      introduction, a prologue and six appendices. However, the novel was
      originally published as three separate volumes, due to post-World War II
      paper shortages and size and price considerations. The Two Towers covers
      Books Three and Four. Tolkien wrote: "The Two Towers gets as near as
      possible to finding a title to cover the widely divergent Books Three and
      Four; and can be left ambiguous." At this stage he planned to title the
      individual books. The proposed title for Book Three was The Treason of
      Isengard. Book Four was titled The Journey of the Ringbearers or The Ring
      Goes East. The titles The Treason of Isengard and The Ring Goes East were
      used in the Millennium edition. In other editions the Books are often
      untitled.

    <p style="width: 50%">
      Tolkien conceived of The Lord of the Rings as a single work comprising six
      "books" plus extensive appendices. In 1953, he proposed titles for the six
      books to his publisher, Rayner Unwin; Book Five was to be The War of the
      Ring, while Book Six was to be The End of the Third Age. These titles were
      eventually used in the (2000) Millennium edition. Rayner Unwin however
      split the work into three volumes, publishing the fifth and sixth books
      with the appendices into the final volume with the title The Return of the
      King. Tolkien felt the chosen title revealed too much of the story, and
      indicated that he preferred The War of the Ring as a title for the volume.
      The Return of the King was in the end published as the third and final
      volume of The Lord of the Rings, on 20 October 1955 in the UK.
